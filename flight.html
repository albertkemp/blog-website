    <p>13 Jul 2024</p>

    <p>Today I will be flying Thai Airways TG466 from Melbourne Airport (MEL) to Bangkok (BKK) on a A350-900.</p>

    <p>The checkin was pretty fast with no delays. A massive Qantas Airbus a380 was parked outside our terminal.<br>I got a look at the airplane before boarding from the terminal. Itâ€™s a beautiful A350-900 in Thai airways livery.</p>
    <p><br>Boarding was also pretty fast and soon we were taking off. I would give the comfort and cabin service a pretty good review for this</p>

    <p>airline. The seats were comfortable and padded. The entertainment screen is decent quality with lots of entertainment options, a sky chat window and pretty fast. There were some annoying ads, though.</p>

    <p><br>Another nice feature was the tray table that had an option for just a drink with a partial fold down.</p>

    <p>After takeoff, meal service started for lunch and the inflight meal was actually surprisingly good for something microwaved. There were vegetarian options as well as beef and chicken options for the main course. After that there were some sides such as smoked salmon and slaw, a brioche bun and carrot cake.<br>Overall, the flight was a good experience with an impressive entertainment system and it might be a good airline for your next trip.</p>
